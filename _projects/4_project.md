## Overview
**Context**  
Leichte Sprache (LS) and Einfache Sprache (ES) are two simplified forms of German that are viewed, both socially and theoretically, as distinct language varieties. This distinction suggests that texts identified as LS will differ from those identified as ES. In this article, we present a collection of simplified news texts from public broadcasters labeled as LS or ES and examine how these labels differ and overlap in actual practice.

**My Role**  
Researcher: designed the methodology, built dataset, conducted quantitative analyses, conducted survey.  

**Timeline**  
3-4 months (data selection, data collection, linguistic analysis, manual analysis, survey)

**Team & Collaboration**  
Worked with collaborators at Hochschule Darmstadt (Germany) and University of Postdam (Germany).  
Interviewed editors of the selected broadcasting platforms.

## 🎯 Research Question
> To what extent can specific, empirically identifiable linguistic or structural parameters distinguish between LS and ES news articles, and what factors influence the assignment of one label over the other?

---

## Methods

**Approach**
1. Collected 300 texts from 4 different broadcasting platforms, which led to a total of 1200 texts.   
   - **NDR** (LS)
   - **MDR** (LS)
   - **Dlf** (ES)
   - **SR** (ES)

2. Analyzed linguistic features related to complexity to observe whether there are any parameters that can be clearly and empirically assigned to LS or ES. 

3. Conducted surveys with the editors of each broadcasting platform to understand the reasoning behind choosing one label over the other (LS or ES). 

4. Manual analysis was conducted on 12 selected texts (3 per broadcaster). This analysis helped capture nuances that the automatic analysis could not. 
   

**Why These Methods**
- Balanced qualitative and quantitative insights, which provided a more detailed analysis of the texts.  
- Understanding of the use of one tag or another and of the vision that editors have of their own content.

## Key Findings & Insights

- Certain parameters can be empirically linked to LS or ES. However, the differences are not absolute, as some parameters remain stable across all datasets. 
- The two varieties cannot be clearly separated based on linguistic features; they form overlapping positions on a continuum of simplification with features that shift depending on editorial practice and broadcaster tendencies 
- The choice of label reflects editorial practices (R3). ES is preferred for its flexibility, while LS is chosen for its rule-based framework and focus on maximizing comprehensibility.

## Design Recommendations & Impact

**Recommendations**
- Broadcasters would benefit from guidelines grounded in empirical findings rather than only tradition or institutional preference. 
- Introducing a graded scale of simplification, or explicitly acknowledging continuum-based practices, could help editors select labels that better reflect the actual linguistic properties of a text. 
- Editors expressed varying understandings of LS and ES. Workshops or reference materials that highlight empirical distinctions, typical linguistic features, and best practices would support greater consistency both within and across broadcasting platforms.

**Impact**
- The research provides empirical grounding in a space often shaped by assumptions. It shows that LS and ES occupy overlapping regions of a simplification continuum, shifting the discussion from binary classification toward a more nuanced understanding of text complexity. 
- Insights from the survey and manual analysis shed light on how editors conceptualize simplification.
- The study highlights inconsistencies in how LS and ES are applied. This can motivate initiatives toward shared editorial guidelines, fostering more consistent and transparent language accessibility practices acorss Germany.

## Reflections 

- Confirmed that LS and ES are not two completely different simplified variants of the German langauge, but rather stand in a continuum of complexity, with recurrent overlaps in linguistic parameters. 
- The choice of one label over the other does not necessarily mean that the content is written in that format.

## Outcome Statement
> By evaluating ChatGPT’s ability to adapt Spanish texts for users with cognitive disabilities, I found that while lexical simplification is achievable, **true accessibility demands human-in-the-loop workflows**, attention to **format and layout**, and **direct user validation**.
